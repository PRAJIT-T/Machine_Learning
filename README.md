# Titanic Survival Classification – Machine Learning Project
Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning classification project based on the Titanic survival dataset.
The objective of the project is to analyze structured passenger data and build models that predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

The dataset includes demographic and travel-related attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, family relations, and fare information.
# Dataset
Dataset: Titanic Survival Dataset
Type: Structured tabular data
Task: Binary classification (Survived / Not Survived)

# Branch Structure
Each branch represents an independent implementation of the same classification problem using a different machine learning model:

Bhuvaneshwaran – SVM
Support Vector Machine–based classification

Niranjan S – Decision Tree
Tree-based classification approach

Prajit – L2 Regularization
Logistic regression with L2 regularization

Sriram S – Random Forest
Ensemble-based classification using Random Forest

This branching structure allows comparison of model behavior while keeping the application and dataset consistent.
